In this post, I will be sharing my experience with Harvard's online course - **CS50's Intro. to AI with Python Review** (link to [official site](https://pll.harvard.edu/course/cs50s-introduction-artificial-intelligence-python), [edX](https://www.edx.org/learn/artificial-intelligence/harvard-university-cs50-s-introduction-to-artificial-intelligence-with-python)).

## Overview

- **Difficulty**: 6.5 out of 10.0
- **Enjoyment**: 9.5 out of 10.0
- **Taught** by [Brain Yu](https://brianyu.me/).
- **Format**:
  - This course is offered on the [edX](https://www.edx.org/) platform.
  - It it an introductary course that touches upon different topics of AI and gives overviews on these topics.
    - Touches some data structure and algorithm stuffs (BFS, DFS, A\*)
    - as well as machine learning ideas (neural networks, NLP).
  - The assignments are...
    - mostly graded by autograders, but they are really lenient and easy to work with.
    - mostly of the form of completing an essential functionality of a function, with other parts being supplied beforehand.
    - question prompts are very clear in what is expected for us to do.
    - the related online communities in this course is also really helpful, as well as well-regulated. People are really active on those Discord channels.

## Would I recommend this course?

Absolutely.

All in all, I would recommend anyone with **intermediate Python experience** (such as knowledge of Python class syntaxes and experience with some of the modules in Python's standard library) as well as wanting to learn some AI basics taking this course.

One should also keep in mind that this course is _not intended to be an intensive, deep dive into the topics_. If you already had a specific topic in mind and wanted to dive real deep into it, perhaps this might not be the correct course for you.

## About Enrollment and Certificate

One can enroll in this course **for free**. Upon completion, Harvard will give the student a certificate hosted on their website (also for free); however, if you want a certificate offered by edX, then there is a fee to it.

The certificate looks like this...
