## CSE 6040 Computating for Analytics

* **Difficulty**: 5.0 out of 10.0
* **Enjoyment**: 8.5 out of 10.0
* **Format**:
    * This course mainly uses Python for homeworks.
    * HW are mostly on weekly basis. All Jupyter notebooks.
    * Exams are open book, but no Github Copilot, posting exam questions on forums, interacting with other people.
* **Tips**:
    * Do HW as soon as possible. More difficult to complete hw under time pressure for coding HWs.
    * Do practice questions before exam.

## ISYE 6501 Introduction to Analytics Modeling

* **Difficulty**: 4.0 out of 10.0
* **Enjoyment**: 8.5 out of 10.0
* **Format**:
    * This course mainly uses R for homeworks. Few exceptions:
        1. For linear programming, Python's PuLP is needed.
        2. For discrete event simulation, either Arena or Python's SimPy are needed.
    * HW are mostly on weekly basis. All Jupyter notebooks.
    * Exams are open book, but no Github Copilot, posting exam questions on forums, interacting with other people.
* **Tips**:
    * Do HW as soon as possible. More difficult to complete hw under time pressure for coding HWs.
    * Do practice questions before exam.
