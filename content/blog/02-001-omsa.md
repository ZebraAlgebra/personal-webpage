## CSE 6040 Computing for Data Analysis

- **Difficulty**: 5.0 out of 10.0
- **Enjoyment**: 8.5 out of 10.0
- **Format**:
  - HW: Weekly basis. All Jupyter notebooks.
  - Exams: 3 exams.
    - Open book, but no Github Copilot, posting exam questions on forums, or interacting with other people.
    - Similar to homeworks and practice problems.
  - Projects: None.
  - Content:
    - Basics of data wrangling and numerical computation in Python (data structures, Numpy, Scipy sparse matrices, Pandas)
    - Basics of SQL (`SELECT`, `JOIN`, `WHERE`, `GROUPBY`... clauses).
    - Several basic demos of ML algorithms (regression, K-means, PCA).
- **Tips**:
  - Do HW as soon as possible. More difficult to complete hw under time pressure for coding HWs.
  - Do practice questions before exam.

## ISYE 6501 Introduction to Analytics Modeling

- **Difficulty**: 4.0 out of 10.0
- **Enjoyment**: 8.5 out of 10.0
- **Format**:
  - HW: Weekly basis. All R markdowns, with a few exceptions:
    - For linear programming, Python's PuLP is needed.
    - For discrete event simulation, either Arena or Python's SimPy are needed.
  - Exams: 3 exams.
  - Project: 1 project, details released near the end of semester.
  - Content: Learning how to use some ML models in R on data, assess model quality, as well as teaching some basic data science ideas.
- **Tips**:
  - Get used to R and R markdown notebooks, as well as figuring out a suitable workflow, since students have to generate a report file every week.

## ISYE 6644 Simulation

- **Difficulty**: 3.5 out of 10.0
- **Enjoyment**: 8.0 out of 10.0
- **Format**:
  - HW: Weekly basis. Multiple choice questions on Canvas.
  - Exams: 3 exams. Allows cheat sheets.
  - Project: 1 project.
  - Content:
    - Probabilities, statistics bootcamps.
    - The Arena software,
    - Theories for simulating random number generators and stochastic processes.
- **Tips**:
  - Read Prof. Goldsman's book on probabilities and stats.
  - The tip for having a good score on exams is to compile good cheat sheets.
- **Misc.**:
  - Prof. Goldsman's lecture videos has some funny jokes.

## MGT 8803 Business Fundamentals for Analytics

- **Difficulty**: 8.5 out of 10.0
- **Enjoyment**: 5.5 out of 10.0
- **Format**:
  - HW: 2 small ones that accounts for 10% of total grade.
  - Exams: 5 exams for each 5 modules (see below). Allows the use of excel. No cheat sheets.
  - Project: None.
  - Content: 5 modules
    - Financial Accounting
    - Finance
    - Supply Chain
    - Business Strategy
    - Marketing
- **Tips**:
  - The first two modules are extremely packed with info. For people without background related to these fields, all the concepts in these modules can take a fiar while to be digested. Tips for studying for the first two exams
    - Do the self assessment questions repeatedly
    - Get used to the Excel workflow for doing the accounting, finance calculations
    - Check for study cards online, some OMSA alumnis prepared them, e.g. this one on [quizlet](https://quizlet.com/434208661/mgt-8803-accounts-exam-1-flash-cards/).
- **Misc.**:
  - As mentioned above, the first two modules are extremely difficult for me. I pulled three all-nighters at the library just to study for these 2 exams.
