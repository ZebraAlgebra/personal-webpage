## Foreword

![](../pulp.png)

`PuLP` is a powerful Python module for solving linear programming problems.

I used this tool recently in one of the homeworks of `ISYE 6501` - _Introduction to Analytics Modeling_, where we were asked to solve _the diet problem_ - similar to the one given in this [link](https://neos-guide.org/case-studies/om/the-diet-problem/).

`Pulp` is easy and intuitive to use, with very clear documentation. The purpose of this post is to give a very brief overview on how to work with this module.

## Basics of Linear Program

### Anatomy of a Linear Program

A linear program mainly has the following three parts:

1. **An objective function** - a linear expression which we want to either maximize or minimize
2. **Some constraints** - expressed as equalities or inequalities of linear expressions
3. **Variables** - sometimes with additional bounds or restrictions (such as integrality).

### A Basic Example

Let us use an artificial basic example as an aid for illustration.

- Johnny has `10` dollars, and wants to spend them on Oreo and Reese's Puffs. Each unit of Oreo and Reese's Puffs cost `3`, `4` dollars.

- Johnny wants to maximize happiness, which he associated to each unit of Oreo or Reese's Puffs numerical constants `11`, `12`.

- Johnny can only buy integral unit amounts of these things.

If we let `x` to be the variable for Oreo, and `y` the variable for Reese's Puffs, then:

1. The objective is to maximize `11x + 12y`
2. The constraint is `3x + 4y <= 10`
3. The variable restrictions are `x, y` has to be nonnegative integers.

### Some Working Knowledge

For the case where variables needn't be integers or binaries, there are several good solvers, and most LP-solvers nowadays can solve such systems in a flash even when such system has an absurd amount of variables and constraints.

If we require the variables to be integers or binaries, then the problem is significantly harder to solve. For example, the [minimum vertex covering problem](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vertex_cover#Computational_problem) in graph theory - which is NP complete - can be written as an integral linear programming problem.

I highly recommend the short book [Understanding and Using Linear Programming](https://link.springer.com/book/10.1007/978-3-540-30717-4) by Jiří Matoušek , Bernd Gärtner for looking into the maths and applications of lieanr programming.

Now let us look at how to transpose this into a `PuLP` program.

## `PuLP`'s API design

### Some `PuLP` classes

Corresponding to the mathematical constituents of a linear program, `PuLP` has the following useful counterparts:

| Class                | Description                                                                                                                                                      |
| -------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `LpVariable`         | A symbolic variable. Can be declared with a name, lower/upper bounds, or having type integer or binary.                                                          |
| `LpAffineExpression` | A numeric combination of `LpVariable`s. It can be declared via a list of `[(LpVariable, coeff)]` pairs.                                                          |
| `LpConstraint`       | An `LpAffineExpression` with some additional infos - such as the inequality type, name of constraint.                                                            |
| `LpProblem`          | An environment for collecting the objective functions, constraints, variable infos, to minimize or maximize, as well as executing the linar programming solvers. |

### Solving the problem with `PuLP`

Some of the details of syntaxes are clear in the [internal documentations](https://coin-or.github.io/pulp/technical/pulp.html).

```python
from pulp import *

# Declare Variables
var_x = LpVariable(name="Oreo", lowBound=0, cat="Integer")
var_y = LpVariable(name="Reese's Puffs", lowBound=0, cat="Integer")

# Declare Expressions
expr_obj = LpAffineExpression([(var_x, 11), (var_y, 12)])
expr_constraint = LpAffineExpression([(var_x, 3), (var_y, 4)])

# Declare Constraints
constraint = LpConstraint(expr_constraint, sense=-1, rhs=10)

# Declare Problem and Add Details to it
problem = LpProblem(name="Johnny's Scheme", sense=-1)
problem += expr_obj
problem += constraint

# Call Solve
problem.solve()

print(f"Status Code: {problem.status}") # 1 = success
print(f"Result:")
print({v.name: v.varValue for v in problem.variables()})

# output:
# ...
# Status Code: 1
# Result:
# {'Oreo': 2.0, "Reese's_Puffs": 1.0}
```

Now Johnny's happy 😊.
