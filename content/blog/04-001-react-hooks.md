I will be making a series of posts on the fundamental and core concepts of React.

## Motivation

Recently, I was trying to build a webapp to as a demo for my course project (to the course `ISYE 6644 Simulation`), but I haven't been using React for a while since my semester in GT's OMSA started, so it took me a while to review the workflow, the environment setup, the syntaxes, and most importantly, the hooks.

The first post will be on hooks. There is a recent [Youtube playlist](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLApy4UwQM3UrZsBTY111R6P4frt6WK-G2) by [Cosden Solutions](https://www.youtube.com/@cosdensolutions) that goes into the details of the hooks quite nicely.
