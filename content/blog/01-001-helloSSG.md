Under the convention that every first thing starts with **hello**, the name of this post is self-explanatory.

## Why a personal website?

To have things to put on LinkedIn. Also as a way to jot down some thoughts and discoveries.

## How is this site generated?

### Short answer

This site is built using [Zola](https://www.getzola.org/), with theme [anemone](https://github.com/Speyll/anemone), hosted on [Netlify](https://www.netlify.com/).

### Not-so-short answer

- This static site is built using the static site generator (SSG) [Zola](https://www.getzola.org/), which is Rust🦀-based. SSG is a convenient tool for generating nice webpages from Markdown files supplied by the user.
- The theme used in this site (which can be roughly understood as a set of pre-built configurations and clever customizations) is called [anemone](https://github.com/Speyll/anemone).
- This site is hosted on [Netlify](https://www.netlify.com/), which provides services for hosting sites; for small sites, no fee is needed.

### How to get started?

1. Install [Rust](https://www.rust-lang.org/tools/install) and [Zola](https://www.getzola.org/documentation/getting-started/installation/).
2. Browse the [themes gallery](https://www.getzola.org/themes/), find one that you like the most and clone that into your machine.
3. Add contents.

That's basically it!
