People are really active on those Discord channels.</ul></ul></ul><h2 id=would-i-recommend-this-course>Would I recommend this course?</h2><p>Absolutely.<p>All in all, I would recommend anyone with <strong>intermediate Python experience</strong> (such as knowledge of Python class syntaxes and experience with some of the modules in Python’s standard library) as well as wanting to learn some AI basics taking this course.<p>One should also keep in mind that this course is <em>not intended to be an intensive, deep dive into the topics</em>. If you already had a specific topic in mind and wanted to dive real deep into it, perhaps this might not be the correct course for you.<h2 id=about-enrollment-and-certificate>About Enrollment and Certificate</h2><p>One can enroll in this course <strong>for free</strong>. Upon completion, Harvard will give the student a certificate hosted on their website (also for free); however, if you want a certificate offered by edX, then there is a fee to it.<p>The certificate looks like this…<p><img alt src=../edx.png><h2 id=ready-to-take-this-course>Ready to take this course?</h2><p>Additional details are well-documented on their <a href=https://cs50.harvard.edu/ai/ rel=noopener target=_blank>accompanying website</a>.
